# IUT-SAE2.03

## Important Instrcutions :

- The work of this SAE will be marked upon our project report and an oral presentation of 15 minutes in the last project session supervised by the teacher.
- Submission of our project report (a single PDF file containing all our wor kincluding literature search, bibliographic ressearch, configurations, screen shots, anf technical tests) is submitted at the last session dedicated to our porject but not after this date.
- The project report must include the monitoring form preovided at the beginning of the project (and available online in PDF and editable version). The monitoring form must be completed(team composition, attendance status of members over the course, tasks done for each session and tasks planned for the next session)

-  No other method of submiting your report will be accepted. No delay will be tolerated. The date of the upload/download of our file on Numeric Working Environment will be taken as proof
- Project reports (content and form) will be subjected to anti-plagiarism processing using the university's automated tools

## DeadLines and Timing :
- The time allowed for this assignment is 2h of tutorials, 2h of practical work and 7 hour of project work. These sessions are supervised by a teacher but you also have 8 hours of independent project time to complete the specifications and go further
- The first practical work session will be dedicated to familiarising ourself with our practical environment (with the virtual machine dedicated to the project) and testing the project concepts included in the tutorial text. The following project sessions will be dedicated to the implementation of the workbook until the end.

- Do not hesitate to include in your your project report with a Gantt chart to manage your project and visualise the various tasks and the various associated tasks and their distribution among the project members. Ideally, you should include 2 versions: a version of the forecast chart (at the beginning of the project report), and a final version at the end of the report), and a final version at the end of the report (refined by the actual progress of the project). Remember to prioritise your tasks and divide the work between members.
Writing the project report is part of this and should not be neglected.
